## Food Insecurity in the United States
This project explores food insecurity in the United States during the 2010's at the state level, using Javascript and d3. In particular, it looks at geographic and temporal trends in food insecurity rates and situates these trends within some historical context. Beyond providing details on food insecurity rates, it also allows us to compare total food insecure populations and aggregated food budget shortfalls by state.

### Data Source 
The primary data source for this project was generously provided by Feeding America. It is derived from their [Map the Meal Gap dataset](https://map.feedingamerica.org/).
