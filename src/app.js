    title: 'Food Insecurity Rates Were High After The Great Recession',
    content:
      'Millions of people across the United States (approximately 1 in 9) suffer with food insecurity, meaning they lack regular access to adequate food. This project examines the trends in domestic food insecurity at the state level, from 2012 to 2020. The food insecurity crisis ballooned following the Great Recession, as higher unemployment rates and declines in median household incomes led to higher rates of household poverty. The United States was still in the midst of recovering from the Recession in 2012, and national food insecurity rates were far above pre-Recession levels. Among states, there was a high degree of variation in rates. Southeastern states such as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia suffered from food insecurity rates as high as ~22%, while the national statewide average was about 15%.',

    title: "Insecurity Rates Declined Significantly over the 2010's",
    content:
      'By 2018, state level food insecurity rates had finally returned to Pre-Recession levels. Over this period, food insecurity rates fell in all states - precipitously in most. The drop was especially profound in states like Georgia, South Carolina, and California, where either food insecurity rates or overall populations were previously quite high. The national statewide average had now dropped to approximately ~12%. Despite experiencing some of the higher drops in food insecurity rates, states in the southeast still had, on average, higher food insecurity rates.',

    title: 'But The Estimated Impact of COVID-19 Has Reversed Those Declines',
    content:
      'The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically reduced the ability of Americans to obtain essential needs like shelter and food, and it has likely exacerbated existing health disparities. While significant gains were made in reducing food insecurity in the decade following the Great Recession, these improvements have been threatened by the widespread economic and public health downturn resulting from the pandemic. Unemployment and poverty rates are two of the most significant indicators (per Feeding America), and the critical loss of income and jobs during the pandemic means that many more households are struggling to access adequate, healthy food.  Using estimated changes in unemployment and poverty adjusted based on actual rates at the start of the pandemic, Feeding Americaâ€™s Map the Meal Gap study projects that food insecurity rates rose significantly across all states in 2020.  In most states, projected 2020 rates are higher than 2012 rates, which emphasizes the need to implement stronger policies at the state and federal level to combat food insecurity. ',
